# HandwrittenDigitRecognizer


## Competition Description
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

This repo encourages you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.
